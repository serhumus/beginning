This was a prototype of a ERP System with focus on my own needs,
that is, personal finances, division of resources with partners, 
access to personal informations to each user, etc. But, issue the slow 
development and deploy, and problems with "remake the wheel", i decided
use a framework, so i want study a litle of Laravel or still Angular
to make the complete system in a near future. 

While can i am learn.


Sorry for this project frustrate so far...
